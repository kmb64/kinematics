I limped my way\n        to the doctor the next morning to be told I need to go see a specialist the next day to receive a cortisone\n        injection but in the meantime I am to take these anti inflammatory tablets. The next day I got myself to the\n        specialist slowly and went straight in. The nurse told me that I had trochanteric bursitis, I was like I have\n        what? As I was asking for an explanation the specialist walks in and starts telling me exactly what\'s going on\n        in my hip! Within 5 minutes in goes this painful needle, I hate needles at the best of times and can normally\n        still handle them but this thing felt like it was aggravating my bones. I could actually feel it moving\n        around!</p>\n\n      <p>So I get told that I have done really well and the most painful part will kick in after a few hours if not in\n        the middle of the night. Great I thought! The next couple of days were so painful and then a miracle happened on\n        day three....no pain! I was like awesome this is fantastic, I can\'t believe a needle can fix this.</p>\n\n      <p>After a month the pain came back and I was back to square one. After talking to a numerous amount of people I\n        found out that a cortisone doesn\'t actually fix the problem but is like a band aid that relieves the pain for a\n        little while. I was talking to a friend and she said you need to go see my Physio, he actually looks after the\n        Richmond Football club. I thought hmmmm he must know what he is doing, so I went and saw him and he was great.\n        Helped me with some exercises and said u have to do these otherwise it\'s not going to fix the problem. He was\n        right. I saw him for a couple of months and then he said to me I don\'t need to see u unless u are in pain. So I\n        kept up my with my exercises and I was all good. A year later I started doing reformer Pilates and yoga. The\n        pain came back but I thought I\'ll just live with it because no one has been able to fix the problem and I was\n        sick of doing all those exercises. Then one day my partner comes home and says I found this Physio/podiatrist u\n        have to go see him! I\'m like I dunno, he goes I told him about your hip and he said he can help u. I thought ok,\n        last time. If this doesn\'t work then I will just live with this.</p>\n\n      <p>So off I went and saw Pep Karalus. In my mind I just kept thinking if this doesn\'t work then this\n        is definitely the last person I will see but in saying that I thought he must know what he is doing if he spent\n        5 years with the All Blacks! I walked out of there going wow, getting emotional because not only was he thorough\n        and explained everything but he said \"I can definitely help you\" for the first time I actually had confidence in\n        someone. So I saw Pep twice a week for 3 weeks until I was comfortable. I was in the middle of a 100 day\n        Yoga/Pilates challenge also and he said I\'m sorry but u can\'t finish it, you need to rest. I was devastated but\n        I knew he was right, his motto was/is short term pain for long term gain. So after having the Prolotherapy\n        injection I started to feel amazing, no pain whatsoever. I felt like I was winning until I decided to do a Yoga\n        class (even though he told me to rest) and the pain came back, I managed to strain something which caused pain\n        in my hip again. So this time I listened, one whole month of no exercise! It was killing me that I couldn\'t do\n        anything but after that month I felt fantastic. No niggles, no pain no nothing! Pep keeps saying thank you for\n        believing in me, I\'m like no mate, Thank you for fixing me :)</p>\n\n\n      <footer><cite title=\"Source Title\">Silvana R</cite></footer>\n    </blockquote>\n\n    <p></p>\n  </div>\n</div>");

Shockwave & Isokinetics uses the most\n        up-to-date, top of the line acoustic devices available and are the pioneers of this treatment in the region with\n        over 16 years of clinical experience.</p>\n\n      <p>If you are suffering from an unresolved chronic injury, or wanting to improve your performance, book a\n        consultation to determine if we may be of service to help you.</p>\n\n\n    </div>\n\n  </div>\n\n  <div class=\"row\">\n\n    <div class=\"col-lg-3\">\n      <img src=\"images/services/tape.png\" class=\"img-rounded img-responsive\" />\n    </div>\n\n    <div class=\"col-lg-9\">\n\n      <h3>TMax Tape and KenesioLogic Taping Techniques</h3>\n\n      <p>Kinesiology is the study of movement mechanics; however movement is not strictly mechanical. Movement involves\n        the neurological, chemical, immunological and physical processes all working synergistically. Disruptions to this\n        synergy can lead to injury and dysfunction.</p>\n\n      <p>KenesioLogicâ„¢ incorporates the total synergy of human movement and function in our taping technique. Our Tmax\n        tapes are manufactured with several distinct features necessary to optimise recovery and function. KenesioLogicâ„¢\n        techniques using Tmax tape in combination provide the most effective form of bio-cellular transduction to bring\n        about optimal healing responses and performance.</p>\n\n      <p>The Tmax difference:</p>\n\n      <ul>\n        <li>200% fabric elasticity â€“ provides fluidity of motion and better recoil.</li>\n        <li>Cotton Spandex fabric â€“ close similarity to natural skinâ€™s elasticity.</li>\n        <li>Wave pattern wave adhesive â€“ better skin respiration and reduced irritation.</li>\n        <li>Acrylic medical grade adhesive â€“ excellent and cohesive sustained contact lifespan.</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <p>Since 2009, training sessions have been successfully operating for health care practitioners to demonstrate the\n        correct use and application of these tapes.
