      <h3>Acoustic Medical Wave Treatment</h3>

      <p>Acoustic waves were first used in medicine to break kidney stones. Its use has now expanded into several medical
        disciplines including; sports, orthopaedics, cardiology and vascular applications. Acoustic medical waves are a
        drug free and non-invasive treatment option to help you recover rapidly and safely. Acoustic medical waves helps
        the body recover by regulating inflammation, pain signals, collagen growth, and stem cell proliferation.</p>

      <p>Our specialised provider <i>(Kenneth Craig – Shockwave & Isokinetic Centre)</i> is currently the Vice-president and
        President elect of the International Society for Medical Shockwave Treatment (ISMST), with research collaboration,
        journal publications, and medical treatment patents in his area of practice. Shockwave & Isokinetics uses the most
        up-to-date, top of the line acoustic devices available and are the pioneers of this treatment in the region with
        over 16 years of clinical experience.</p>

      <p>If you are suffering from an unresolved chronic injury, or wanting to improve your performance, book a
        consultation to determine if we may be of service to help you.</p>

      <h3>TMax Tape and KenesioLogic Taping Techniques</h3>

      <p>Kinesiology is the study of movement mechanics; however movement is not strictly mechanical. Movement involves
        the neurological, chemical, immunological and physical processes all working synergistically. Disruptions to this
        synergy can lead to injury and dysfunction.</p>

      <p>KenesioLogic™ incorporates the total synergy of human movement and function in our taping technique. Our Tmax
        tapes are manufactured with several distinct features necessary to optimise recovery and function. KenesioLogic™
        techniques using Tmax tape in combination provide the most effective form of bio-cellular transduction to bring
        about optimal healing responses and performance.</p>

      <p>The Tmax difference:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>200% fabric elasticity – provides fluidity of motion and better recoil.</li>
        <li>Cotton Spandex fabric – close similarity to natural skin’s elasticity.</li>
        <li>Wave pattern wave adhesive – better skin respiration and reduced irritation.</li>
        <li>Acrylic medical grade adhesive – excellent and cohesive sustained contact lifespan.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Since 2009, training sessions have been successfully operating for health care practitioners to demonstrate the
        correct use and application of these tapes. Why settle for less? Contact us to know more about KenesioLogic™
        training workshops.</p>
