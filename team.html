  <div class="col-lg-9">

    <p>Pep has been working as a musculoskeletal sports clinician for the past 7 years. Pep specialises in the assessment of whole body biomechanics with a special interest in lower limb musculoskeletal injuries. </p>

    <p>Pep started out his career studying Physiotherapy before transitioning on to do Podiatry in order to gain a more extensive understanding of the ground reaction forces of the foot and the result of these forces on the rest of the body. After completing Podiatry, Pep furthered his biomechanical knowledge by completing multiple running and performance courses.</p>

    <p>Throughout his career, Pep has worked for provincial, national and international sporting teams and was a provider for the New Zealand Rugby Union for 5 years. Pep has also worked closely with players from Otago ITM and Super 15 Rugby teams as well as representative athletics, basketball, cricket and netball players.</p>

    <p>Pep assesses the biomechanics and alignment of the body as a whole and does not just treat in area isolation. Treatment techniques include; foot, ankle and knee mobilisations, dry needling, remedial massage, Prolotherapy and exercise rehabilitation. Pep works closely alongside Ken Craig, the Vice President of the International Society of Medical Shockwave Treatment and founder of Isokinetics and Shockwave Health and Performance Clinic.</p>

    <p>Pep is a national distributor of KenesioLogic taping and in the near future looks forward to running biomechanics courses incorporating education on the correct application of this groundbreaking product.</p>

    <p>Ken is the pioneer of medical Shockwave and Flashwave therapy in the Southern Hemisphere with over 16 years of
      clinical application and research in this field. He is currently the Vice-President and President elect of the
      International
      Society for Medical Shockwave Treatment (ISMST), and a managing board member of this society. His key field of
      interest is in:
      sports and general injury rehabilitation, performance resilience optimisation, pain management, age related
      muscle imbalances and joint related issues.</p>

    <p>His research work into skeletal muscle development and endogenous stem-cell proliferation using Flaswaves
      receives great international interest, and is an invited key speaker in this field internationally. He has
      several publication and treatment protocols patents to his name.</p>

    <p>Ken combines his knowledge of pharmacology, human function, injury management, and functional exercise
      prescription to achieve a high level of successful treatment outcomes. He does not believe in symptomatic
      management of any condition, but rather a functional, regenerative and restorative programme.</p>
