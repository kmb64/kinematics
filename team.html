  <div class="col-lg-9">

    <p>Pep has been working as a musculoskeletal sports clinician for the past 7 years. Pep specialises in the assessment of whole body biomechanics with a special interest in lower limb musculoskeletal injuries. </p>

    <p>Pep started out his career studying Physiotherapy before transitioning on to do Podiatry in order to gain a more extensive understanding of the ground reaction forces of the foot and the result of these forces on the rest of the body. After completing Podiatry, Pep furthered his biomechanical knowledge by completing multiple running and performance courses.</p>

    <p>Throughout his career, Pep has worked for provincial, national and international sporting teams and was a provider for the New Zealand Rugby Union for 5 years. Pep has also worked closely with players from Otago ITM and Super 15 Rugby teams as well as representative athletics, basketball, cricket and netball players.</p>

    <p>Pep assesses the biomechanics and alignment of the body as a whole and does not just treat in area isolation. Treatment techniques include; foot, ankle and knee mobilisations, dry needling, remedial massage, Prolotherapy and exercise rehabilitation. Pep works closely alongside Ken Craig, the Vice President of the International Society of Medical Shockwave Treatment and founder of Isokinetics and Shockwave Health and Performance Clinic.</p>

    <p>Pep is a national distributor of KenesioLogic taping and in the near future looks forward to running biomechanics courses incorporating education on the correct application of this groundbreaking product.</p>
