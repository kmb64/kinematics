      <p>I first saw Pep when I had a Hip injury. As a middle distance runner, it was very important to me that this
        issue was fixed quickly so I could get back into full training. Pep quickly diagnosed it as hip bursitis and
        proceeded to explain the process of getting rid of it. He also explained what the likely causes of the injury
        were and what we could do to prevent it from happening in the future. Pep has an incredible amount of
        professional experience and an unbelievable understanding of the biomechanics of the human body. He is one of
        the best communicators I have dealt with and I now continue to see him on a fortnightly basis for his expertise
        and guidance on my training programs. I strongly urge any athlete or individual to seek Pep's help.</p>

      <p>About 2 years ago I re injured my knee and this is when I first met Josh</p>

      <p>Josh and I did sessions in the gym as well as in the clinic. Being a mother of 3 kids as well as working full
        time Josh was able to see me after work which some nights was 5.30pm at the gym. This made it possible for me to
        attend each session.</p>

      <p>Josh's knowledge, in what I required as well as his commitment is truly outstanding. He not only tailored an
        individual gym program for me, he also answer any queries that I had and ensured that I understood my injury and
        what I need to do to get back to playing. After seeing a surgeon, I have had surgery on my knee to remove scar
        tissue. I am currently in rehab and due to my kidâ€™s sports commitments, Josh has given me a program that he has
        tailored for me which I am able to do at home. I know that once I have done this I will be back to playing
        sports within the next 3 months</p>

      <p>I would like to wish Josh all the best for his future endeavours and know that whoever has the privilege of
        having Josh as their Physiotherapist will be very lucky</p>

      <p><p>I had been having years of ankle pain from years of playing rugby! </p></p>

      <p>I had been referred to see Ken for my ankle which was diagnosed by another clinician with a spur on the talus
        which the only option was to have it operated.</p>

      <p>At the time I didn't have the money for surgery and also the option to sit out of work so I was keen to see Ken
        for second opinion.</p>

      <p>I was amazed with Kens clinical skills and humour which made me feel very comfortable so I was open to any type
        of treatment offered.</p>

      <p>We went through Shockwave option and after 2 treatments I have not had any pain or discomfort throughout the
        day.</p>

      <p>The best thing EVER and I still can not believe it!!!!!</p>

      <p>I recommend Ken to anyone who is having either acute or chronic pain.</p>

      <p>About 2 and a half years ago my left hip gave way one day to the point where I couldn't walk. I limped my way
        to the doctor the next morning to be told I need to go see a specialist the next day to receive a cortisone
        injection but in the meantime I am to take these anti inflammatory tablets. The next day I got myself to the
        specialist slowly and went straight in. The nurse told me that I had trochanteric bursitis, I was like I have
        what? As I was asking for an explanation the specialist walks in and starts telling me exactly what's going on
        in my hip! Within 5 minutes in goes this painful needle, I hate needles at the best of times and can normally
        still handle them but this thing felt like it was aggravating my bones. I could actually feel it moving
        around!</p>

      <p>So I get told that I have done really well and the most painful part will kick in after a few hours if not in
        the middle of the night. Great I thought! The next couple of days were so painful and then a miracle happened on
        day three....no pain! I was like awesome this is fantastic, I can't believe a needle can fix this.</p>

      <p>After a month the pain came back and I was back to square one. After talking to a numerous amount of people I
        found out that a cortisone doesn't actually fix the problem but is like a band aid that relieves the pain for a
        little while. I was talking to a friend and she said you need to go see my Physio, he actually looks after the
        Richmond Football club. I thought hmmmm he must know what he is doing, so I went and saw him and he was great.
        Helped me with some exercises and said u have to do these otherwise it's not going to fix the problem. He was
        right. I saw him for a couple of months and then he said to me I don't need to see u unless u are in pain. So I
        kept up my with my exercises and I was all good. A year later I started doing reformer Pilates and yoga. The
        pain came back but I thought I'll just live with it because no one has been able to fix the problem and I was
        sick of doing all those exercises. Then one day my partner comes home and says I found this Physio/podiatrist u
        have to go see him! I'm like I dunno, he goes I told him about your hip and he said he can help u. I thought ok,
        last time. If this doesn't work then I will just live with this.</p>

      <p>So off I went and saw Pep Karalus. In my mind I just kept thinking if this doesn't work then this
        is definitely the last person I will see but in saying that I thought he must know what he is doing if he spent
        5 years with the All Blacks! I walked out of there going wow, getting emotional because not only was he thorough
        and explained everything but he said "I can definitely help you" for the first time I actually had confidence in
        someone. So I saw Pep twice a week for 3 weeks until I was comfortable. I was in the middle of a 100 day
        Yoga/Pilates challenge also and he said I'm sorry but u can't finish it, you need to rest. I was devastated but
        I knew he was right, his motto was/is short term pain for long term gain. So after having the Prolotherapy
        injection I started to feel amazing, no pain whatsoever. I felt like I was winning until I decided to do a Yoga
        class (even though he told me to rest) and the pain came back, I managed to strain something which caused pain
        in my hip again. So this time I listened, one whole month of no exercise! It was killing me that I couldn't do
        anything but after that month I felt fantastic. No niggles, no pain no nothing! Pep keeps saying thank you for
        believing in me, I'm like no mate, Thank you for fixing me :)</p>
