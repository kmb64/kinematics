    <h2>About Us</h2>

    <p>Kinematics Health and Performance Clinic provides a complete approach to the diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation of muscular and skeletal issues.
      Our team has over 30 years of experience in musculoskeletal assessments in Podiatry and Physiotherapy,
      with a demonstrated ability to meet the needs of elite athletes and the general public alike.</p>

    <p>Kinematics specialises in the assessment of functional and sport specific biomechanics (movement patterns) of the whole body in order to identify areas of imbalance.
      If not addressed, these imbalances and poor mechanics often lead to secondary compensations in the body and cascade on to cause other injuries.</p>

    <p>This holistic, whole body approach enables the effective treatment of not only the presenting issue but also the underlying primary cause,
      reducing the risk of the persistence and re-occurrence of injuries. </p>
